##The E-Learning Platform UI is a simple and interactive front-end project designed to provide users with an easy way to access online courses and track their learning progress. The main aim of this project is to create a clean, user-friendly interface that allows learners to browse courses, watch learning content, and monitor their progress in an organized manner. The platform focuses on simplicity so that even beginners can easily understand and use it.
The user interface is divided into multiple pages. The home page displays a list of available courses such as HTML Basics, CSS Styling, and JavaScript Basics. Each course is presented in a card layout with a short description and a “Start Course” button. This helps users quickly identify what they want to learn and navigate to the relevant course page. The navigation bar at the top allows smooth movement between the Courses page and the Progress page.
Each course has its own learning page where a video is embedded for learning purposes. A button is provided to mark the lesson as completed. When the user clicks this button, the progress for that specific course is updated. Instead of combining all progress into one, each course maintains its own progress value. This makes the learning experience more realistic and organized, as users can clearly see how much they have completed in each subject.
The Progress page displays individual progress bars for each course. These progress bars visually represent the completion percentage, making it easy for users to track their learning status at a glance. Progress data is stored using the browser’s local storage, which ensures that progress remains saved even after refreshing the page or reopening the browser. A reset option is also provided to clear progress, which is helpful for testing and repeated practice.
This project is developed using basic web technologies. HTML is used to create the structure of the web pages, including headings, sections, buttons, and navigation links. CSS is used for styling the interface, such as layout, colors, spacing, and progress bars, ensuring a clean and non-overlapping design. JavaScript is used to add interactivity, handle button clicks, store progress values, and dynamically update progress bars based on user actions.

The entire project is developed using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as the code editor. VS Code makes development easier by providing features such as syntax highlighting, file management, and live preview support. Overall, this E-Learning Platform UI demonstrates the practical use of front-end development concepts and provides a solid foundation for building more advanced learning systems in the future.
